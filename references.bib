  shorttitle = {Predicting query execution time},
  abstract = {Predicting query execution time is useful in many database management issues including admission control, query scheduling, progress monitoring, and system sizing. Recently the research community has been exploring the use of statistical machine learning approaches to build predictive models for this task. An implicit assumption behind this work is that the cost models used by query optimizers are insufficient for query execution time prediction. In this paper we challenge this assumption and show while the simple approach of scaling the optimizer's estimated cost indeed fails, a properly calibrated optimizer cost model is surprisingly effective. However, even a well-tuned optimizer cost model will fail in the presence of errors in cardinality estimates. Accordingly we investigate the novel idea of spending extra resources to refine estimates for the query plan after it has been chosen by the optimizer but before execution. In our experiments we find that a well calibrated query optimizer model along with cardinality estimation refinement provides a low overhead way to provide estimates that are always competitive and often much better than the best reported numbers from the machine learning approaches.},

  abstract = {Search spaces generated by query optimizers during the optimization process encapsulate characteristics of the join enumeration algorithms, the cost models, as well as critical decisions made for pruning and choosing the best plan. We demonstrate the Join Enumeration Viewer which is a tool designed for visualizing, mining, and comparing plan search spaces generated by different join enumeration algorithms when optimizing same SQL statement. We have enhanced Sybase SQL Anywhere relational database management system to log, in a very compact format, its search space during an optimization process. Such optimization log can then be analyzed by the Join Enumeration Viewer which internally builds the logical and physical plan graphs representing complete and partial plans considered during the optimization process. The optimization logs also contain statistics of the resource consumption during the query optimization such as optimization time breakdown, for example, for logical join enumeration versus costing physical plans, and memory allocation for different optimization structures. The SQL Anywhere Optimizer implements a highly adaptable, self-managing, search space generation algorithm by having several join enumeration algorithms to choose from, each enhanced with different ordering and pruning techniques. The emphasis of the demonstration will be on comparing and contrasting these join enumeration algorithms by analyzing their optimization logs. The demonstration scenarios will include optimizing SQL statements under various conditions which will exercise different algorithms, pruning and ordering techniques. These search spaces will then be visualized and compared using the Join Enumeration Viewer.},

  abstract = {Want to learn about databases without the tedium? With its unique combination of Japanese-style comics and serious educational content, The Manga Guide to Databases is just the book for you.  Princess Ruruna is stressed out. With the king and queen away, she has to manage the Kingdom of Kod's humongous fruit-selling empire. Overseas departments, scads of inventory, conflicting prices, and so many customers! It's all such a confusing mess. But a mysterious book and a helpful fairy promise to solve her organizational problems-with the practical magic of databases.  In The Manga Guide to Databases, Tico the fairy teaches the Princess how to simplify her data management. We follow along as they design a relational database, understand the entity-relationship model, perform basic database operations, and delve into more advanced topics. Once the Princess is familiar with transactions and basic SQL statements, she can keep her data timely and accurate for the entire kingdom. Finally, Tico explains ways to make the database more efficient and secure, and they discuss methods for concurrency and replication.  Examples and exercises (with answer keys) help you learn, and an appendix of frequently used SQL statements gives the tools you need to create and maintain full-featured databases.  (Of course, it wouldn't be a royal kingdom without some drama, so read on to find out who gets the girl-the arrogant prince or the humble servant.)  This EduManga book is a translation of a bestselling series in Japan, co-published with Ohmsha, Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan.},

  abstract = {Is Query Optimization a “solved” problem? If not, are we attacking the “right” problems? How should we identify the "right" problems to solve? I asked these same questions almost exactly 25 years ago, in an extended abstract for a Workshop on Database Query Optimization that was organized by the then-Professor Goetz Graefe at the Oregon Graduate Center [Grae 89a]. Remarkably and quite regrettably, most of the issues and critical unsolved problems I identified in that brief rant remain true today. Researchers continue to attack the wrong problems, IMHO: they attack the ones that they can, i.e., that they have ideas for, rather than the ones that they should, i.e., that are critical to successfully modeling the true cost of plans and choosing a good one. Perhaps more importantly, that will avoid choosing a disastrous plan! At the risk of repeating myself, I'd like to re-visit these issues, because I'm disappointed that few in the research community have [...]},

  abstract = {For decades researchers have studied the duality of hashing and sorting for the implementation of the relational operators, especially for efficient aggregation. Depending on the underlying hardware and software architecture, the specifically implemented algorithms, and the data sets used in the experiments, different authors came to different conclusions about which is the better approach. In this paper we argue that in terms of cache efficiency, the two paradigms are actually the same. We support our claim by showing that the complexity of hashing is the same as the complexity of sorting in the external memory model. Furthermore we make the similarity of the two approaches obvious by designing an algorithmic framework that allows to switch seamlessly between hashing and sorting during execution. The fact that we mix hashing and sorting routines in the same algorithmic framework allows us to leverage the advantages of both approaches and makes their similarity obvious. On a more practical note, we also show how to achieve very low constant factors by tuning both the hashing and the sorting routines to modern hardware. Since we observe a complementary dependency of the constant factors of the two routines to the locality of the input, we exploit our framework to switch to the faster routine where appropriate. The result is a novel relational aggregation algorithm that is cache-efficient---independently and without prior knowledge of input skew and output cardinality---, highly parallelizable on modern multi-core systems, and operating at a speed close to the memory bandwidth, thus outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to 3.7x.},
