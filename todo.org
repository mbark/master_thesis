* Finish data collection
** DONE Gather new data now that all tables are analyzed
CLOSED: [2016-04-19 Tue 15:00]
** DONE Add functionality to get the count for each alias
CLOSED: [2016-04-19 Tue 15:00]
** DONE Transfer MySql to MariaDb
CLOSED: [2016-04-21 Thu 15:57]
** DONE Test the second query and analyze to see how it performs
CLOSED: [2016-04-21 Thu 15:57]
** DONE Allow MariaDb data to be analyzed as well
CLOSED: [2016-04-21 Thu 15:57]
** DONE Run tests in MariaDb
CLOSED: [2016-04-21 Thu 15:57]
** TODO Go from parsed output to some form of table to display
** TODO Get a few (maybe 9 in total) more queries to test on
** TODO Test mariadb and postgres on all queries
* Report
** DONE Read the method part from Are Query Optimizers Good? for inspiration
CLOSED: [2016-04-12 Tue 11:32]
** DONE Begin writing the method part
CLOSED: [2016-04-12 Tue 13:15]
** DONE Write pseudocode to explain how it works
CLOSED: [2016-04-12 Tue 15:06]
** DONE Add implementation info such as drivers and libraries used
CLOSED: [2016-04-12 Tue 16:27]
** TODO Find the relevant statistics of the database used
** TODO Rephrase from index selection to access method (seq scan vs index is also relevant)
** TODO Add text about transferring the databases from MySQL
** TODO Add references throughout the text
** TODO Flesh out with more info about the choice of dataset
** TODO Remain consistent between dataset or data set
** TODO Add code from the project itself showing the transformation of the data
** TODO Extend the method part with to describe the current implementation
* Questions
** TODO Should I also study the effect the potential incorrect selection has?
** TODO How should the pseudocode be formatted?
** TODO Do we need more than two queries?
** TODO How we argue that these queries are representative?
** TODO How do we argue the underlying database better?
** DONE What are the specs of the computers used? Is that relevant?
** TODO What are the relevant statistics for the database tested?
** TODO How do we show the index usages?
** TODO Should I instead focus on just one query maybe?
