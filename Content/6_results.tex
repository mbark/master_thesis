This chapter contains the results of using the tool to evaluate the two
databases. This chapter will start with a section showing the results when
evaluating the databases to identify a correlation between sample size and
ambiguous indexes. Following this are further results showing the results when
evaluating subsets of the original query.

\section{Correlation between sample size and ambiguous indexes}
This section contains the results for the queries done. The evaluation for query
\#1 can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:plot:query1}.
