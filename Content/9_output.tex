This Appendix contains the output of the program for all of the tests conducted.
The output is the output of the database's \texttt{EXPLAIN} output in
\textit{JSON}-form. The format of the output is a map where each relation is
mapped to a list of the access methods used for that relation. Each access
method is described by a map containing the access method used and, if it is an
index, the name of the index.

For PostgreSQL the access method is described by the field \texttt{"Node Type"}
and \texttt{"Seq Scan"} means a full table scan. If an index is used instead the
\texttt{"Node Type"} is \emph{Index Scan} (or \texttt{"Index Only Scan"}) and the
\texttt{"Index Name"} identifies which index it is that is used.

For MariaDB all relations are accessed using an index and the name of that index
is described in \texttt{"key"}. MariaDB also contains an additional field in the form of
\texttt{"possible\_keys"} which shows what access methods were considered applicable.
